A fun little problem I was not expecting:

```
ng> fmt.Println("hello, world")
hello, world
[13 <nil>]
ng> 
```

The first thing is we should not print a nil error returned from a call,
to mimick the way our "sloppy error handling" will work generally. But
there is no obvious way to avoid printing the int returned by the
printing functions. I guess that settles it, print/printf builtins are
coming.
