I wanted to put off thinking about tables, slices, etc for the
foreseeable future, but I need some answers to implement fmt.Printf.

If we are going to follow in the footsteps of go/types and model the
final parameter to a variadic Printf as []interface{}, then we need to
decide what to convert that into in a Neugram type.

So to revisit some of my original questions on this:

1. Should [|]interface{} be a 2-D table, or an N-D table?
2. Should tables have column names? (How, with N-D tables?)
3. Should we also have slices, or implicitly convert for importog?
4. Is arity baked into the type, or dynamic?
5. Should table and N-D slices be different types?

For now, I am going to avoid introducing slices and instead treat a
[]interface{} as an [|]interface{}. Conversion from a table to a Go
slice will require a dynamic check.

This still makes it possible to introduce N-D tables later.

As an aside, the [,]interface{} syntax from
http://golang.org/design/6282-table-data is nice, maybe I should use
that? Or I could save that for an explicit matrix type?
