TODO:

- implement interfaces in the typechecker
- implement variadic function parameters in the typechecker
- do the same in eval
- consider merging lang/* packages back together (gorename?)

Notes:

My goal for the next few weeks is to make this work:

```
importgo "fmt"
fmt.Println("hello, world")
```

The basics behind importgo I have thought out. The typechecker will
use nothing but Go export data to generate matching Neugram types.
This means to run the above, I need to introduce interfaces into
Neugram. No biggie.

Aside on class: I was reminded that I have this annoying "class" type
right now as the only way to hang methods off a struct. It does not
let you hang methods off any type, which is probably too limiting but
works for now. (We need to be able to work with any Go type, we do not
necessarily need to be able to define every type.) If however I wanted
syntax for this we could write:

```
type A methods on B {
	F() int { return 7 }
	G() bool { return true }
}
```

On names in the typechecker: the go/types package has MethodSet which
conflates both the abstract type (method signatures from an
interface{}) and the concrete type A with concrete method F. I would
like to separate this in the Neugram typechecker. In particular:

```
// Interface is an abstract type -- a set of method signatures.
type Interface struct {
	Methods []*tipe.Func
}

// Methodik is a type with methods.
type Methodik struct {
	Type tipe.Type
	Methods []*expr.FuncLiteral
}
```

A methodik is more than a type, so it does not belong in the tipe
package. It should probably go in lang/expr. Here is a fun note on
the confusion in English around the word methodology:

http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/91339/better-english-equivalent-for-set-of-methods

I am borrowing the German for Methodik just to avoid me confusing
it with go/types use of MethodSet. Gluing two languages together is
hard, even when they are so similar.

Finally, the whole multiple-packages thing for expr/stmt/tipe is
cute but annoying. I amm thinking of putting them all back together.
But I will have to get gorename working because I am not doing all
that typing.
